👋 Hi there, I'm  Mohamed Aziz Theiri!

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm a software engineering student at ESPRIT School, but my journey began with a degree in data science.

🌱 Although my background is in data science, I've recently discovered my love for back end development and I'm eager to delve into it further and  expanding my   
    skills.
    
💡 I believe in the power of collaboration and I'm always looking for opportunities to work on exciting projects.

📫 Interested in collaborating or just want to say hello? Feel free to reach out to me!
